# CSS to the Rescue @cmda-minor-web 2023 - 2024

We find the web fascinating. In recent years, CSS has become a mature and powerful language (no longer a bottleneck - on the contrary). However, many of the (new) CSS features are not yet fully utilised. Some parts of the spec are unfairly (still) not embraced, while other parts are so new and/or complex that we may not have fully grasped the possibilities yet. It's your wonderful task to map out the uncharted territories of the CSS world..

**In this four-week course, you'll be experimenting with CSS techniques that are new (to you). Youâ€™ll create an innovative, experimental, and enjoyable experience - using only vanilla HTML and vanilla CSS (frameworks, preprocessors, libraries, and JavaScript are not allowed).**

## Assignments
The course consists of two assignments:
- Introductory exercise [Themes](themas.html)
